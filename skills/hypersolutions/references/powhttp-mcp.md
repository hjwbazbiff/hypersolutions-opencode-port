# Debugging live requests with powhttp (MCP)

This is the highest-leverage debugging path. powhttp is a local HTTP debugging proxy
that captures your script's real traffic — including **true wire header order** and the
**TLS fingerprint**, neither of which a browser HAR contains. Its MCP server gives
OpenCode read-only access to that captured traffic, so OpenCode can inspect exactly what your
HTTP client put on the wire and compare it to a real Chrome request.

Use this whenever a flow is "blocked but the generated payload looks fine" — the fault is
almost always in the request, and powhttp shows the ground truth.

## Prerequisites (one-time)

1. Install powhttp (https://powhttp.com) and start it. Default capture proxy:
   `http://127.0.0.1:8080`.
2. In powhttp, click **"Run MCP server"**. It listens at `http://localhost:8383/mcp`
   (streamable HTTP transport). This plugin registers that server as **`powhttp`**, so its
   tools appear namespaced as `powhttp_find_requests`,
   `powhttp_get_tls_connection`, `powhttp_get_http2_streams`. (A standalone MCP
   registration under the same `powhttp` key uses these same direct tool names.)
   This plugin defaults to direct tools (`codemode: false`) on OpenCode 2. If your
   server override enables Code Mode, use its native `execute` tool and exact catalog
   paths: `tools.powhttp.find_requests`, `tools.powhttp.get_tls_connection`, and
   `tools.powhttp.get_http2_streams`, passing the same inputs described below.
3. **Prepare HTTPS interception** in Settings → Root Certificate: generate a root
   certificate if none exists, then trust the exported certificate in the test client.
   Enable TLS interception with the session padlock control. With interception off
   or no root certificate, HTTPS can pass through without captured HTTP entries
   even while plaintext HTTP is recorded. Keep certificate trust scoped to the client.
4. **Enable recording in the intended capture session**, then route the failing
   script through the proxy address shown in that session. The displayed port may
   differ from `8080`, especially with multiple sessions. Configure its upstream
   proxy if needed, then run the failing flow. Confirm a new request appears in the
   session before querying MCP. A connected MCP and working proxy can still return
   no entries when recording is off or the wrong session is selected.

> `references/request-rules.md` rules to the HAR entries (note a HAR lacks the real wire
> header order and TLS fingerprint — powhttp is preferred).

## The three tools

### `find_requests` — query captured traffic
Params: `query` (required) + `include` (required) + optional `limit`.
- `query.sessionId`: use `"active"` for the session currently open in powhttp.
- `query.search`: `{ query, isRegex, caseSensitive, sources? }` — filter by URL/headers/body.
- `query.entryIds`: specific entry IDs, or `"active"` for the selected entry.
- `query.state`: filter by UI state (`selected`, `bookmarked`, `colors`, `strikethrough`).
- `include`: array choosing which fields to return — `request_headers`, `request_body`,
  `response_headers`, `response_body`, `websocket_messages`, `timings`, `fingerprint`,
  `process`. **Omit bodies unless needed** to keep responses small; add `limit`.
- Results carry metadata (URL, method, status, timing) plus `tls.connectionId` and
  `http2.streamId` for drilling deeper, and (with `fingerprint`) the client fingerprint.

### `get_tls_connection` — TLS handshake for a connection
Params: `connectionId` (from a `find_requests` result's `tls.connectionId`) + optional
`limit`. Returns the handshake messages (protocol settings of both sides) — use to inspect
the JA3/JA4-level TLS fingerprint and confirm it matches a real Chrome ClientHello.

### `get_http2_streams` — HTTP/2 frames per stream
Params: `connectionId` from **`http2.connectionId`**, plus `streams` (list of
`{ id, limit? }` where `id` is `http2.streamId`). The TLS and HTTP/2 connection IDs
are different: use `tls.connectionId` only for `get_tls_connection`. Passing it to
`get_http2_streams` returns "HTTP/2 connection not found". Returns HEADERS/DATA/SETTINGS frames — use to read the **actual
pseudo-header order** (`:method :authority :scheme :path` for Chrome) and header frames.

## Recommended debug workflow

1. **Locate the target-site requests.** `find_requests` with `sessionId:"active"`, a
   `search` for the target host (or the antibot request, e.g. `/tl`, `reese84`,
   `geo.captcha-delivery.com`, `sensor_data`), `include:["request_headers"]`, small
   `limit`. Ignore third-party/analytics noise.
2. **Check header order & case.** Read the ordered `request_headers`. Compare against a
   real Chrome order (see `references/tls-and-headers.md`). Look for: alphabetical order,
   wrong case for the HTTP version, `priority` not last (HTTP/2), `cookie` misplaced,
   missing `Host` first (HTTP/1.1), a `Host` header present on HTTP/2.
3. **Check the fingerprint.** Re-query with `include:["fingerprint"]`; then
   `get_tls_connection` on the `tls.connectionId` and `get_http2_streams` on the
   `http2.streamId` to confirm the TLS ClientHello and HTTP/2 pseudo-header order match
   Chrome. A mismatch here is the classic "valid payload, still blocked" cause.
4. **Check the response.** Add `include:["response_headers","response_body"]` on the
   blocked request to read the block/challenge (403 `var dd=`, 428 sec-cpt provider, 429
   ips.js / `{"t":...}`) and any `Accept-CH` / `Set-Cookie` the server sent.
5. **Apply the principles.** Work through `references/request-rules.md` against the
   in-scope requests: header order/case, pseudo-header order, sec-ch-ua exact value,
   duplicate cookies, DevTools cache headers, Accept-CH / client-hint pollution,
   `Sec-Fetch-Storage-Access` incognito artifacts, and Chrome-version policy. For
   per-product flow correctness (Akamai SBSD/sensor, DataDome challenge/cookie/image,
   Kasada), use the product reference files — or, if you can export the capture as a HAR,
   run the `analyze_har` MCP for the full maintained check. Track cross-request state
   (cookie propagation, Accept-CH, flow order).
6. **Map findings to fixes.** Route each finding through `references/debugging.md` and the
   relevant product file. Report the confirmed issues most-severe first, with the exact
   header/value to change.

## Tips

- `sessionId:"active"` is almost always what you want — it's the session the user is
  looking at in powhttp.
- Keep responses small: request only the `include` fields you need, use `limit`, and use
  `search` to narrow to the antibot request instead of pulling the whole session.
- The capture is read-only and local, but request headers/bodies contain live cookies and
  tokens — don't echo secrets back to the user unnecessarily; redact when quoting.
- powhttp minimally alters the TLS fingerprint (unlike Charles), so what you see is close
  to the real wire — but if the user's TLS client is itself behind another proxy, account
  for that.
