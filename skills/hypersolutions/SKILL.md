# Hyper Solutions API Integration

## Installed resource paths (OpenCode)

OpenCode 2's native `skill` tool loads this skill with `{ id: "hypersolutions" }`
(use its listed skill ID) and supplies its filesystem base directory. On OpenCode 1,
the same native tool takes `{ name: "hypersolutions" }`.
Resolve every `references/` and `scripts/` path below against that installed skill
directory, not the project working directory. Read referenced files using their
absolute paths. Run the helper with `python3 "<skill-base>/scripts/sec_ch_ua.py" <version>` (or its `--check` / `--selftest` options); substitute the actual base
directory supplied by the skill tool and quote the path. Python 3 is required.

## What this service does (mental model)

Hyper Solutions is a **payload-generation API**. It does **not** make requests to the
target site for you. It takes inputs you collect from the protected site (script
contents, cookies, UUIDs, IP, User-Agent) and returns the **sensor data / cookie /
token** a real browser would produce. **Your code** is responsible for all the actual
HTTP traffic to the target — with a browser-grade TLS client and correct header order.

```
┌────────────┐   1. GET page / script      ┌──────────────┐
│ Your code  │ ──────────────────────────► │ Target site  │
│ (TLS       │ ◄────────────────────────── │ (Akamai/DD/…)│
│  client)   │   2. HTML, cookies, script   └──────────────┘
│            │
│            │   3. inputs (script, cookies, ip, ua)   ┌────────────────────┐
│            │ ──────────────────────────────────────► │ *.hypersolutions.co │
│            │ ◄────────────────────────────────────── │ (this API)          │
│            │   4. generated payload / token           └────────────────────┘
│            │
│            │   5. POST payload back to target ─────►  Target site → valid cookie
└────────────┘
```

If a request is failing, the cause is almost always in **step 1/5 (your TLS client,
header order, cookies, or IP)**, not in the generated payload. See
`references/debugging.md` first.

## Non-negotiable requirements

These apply to **every** product. Standard HTTP libraries (`requests`, `axios`,
`net/http`, `fetch`) will be blocked — they have non-browser TLS fingerprints.

1. **Browser-grade TLS client** with a Chrome fingerprint (e.g. `tls-client`,
   `azuretls-client`, `rnet`/`wreq`, `tlsclientwrapper`). Recommended profile: the
   **latest Chrome profile your client offers**, with **HTTP/3 disabled** (most proxies
   don't support it yet) and **random TLS extension order enabled**.
2. **Exact browser header order**, including HTTP/2 pseudo-header order. This is a top
   fingerprinting signal and DevTools does **not** show the real order.
3. **Session consistency**: the same User-Agent, TLS fingerprint, IP, and header order
   for the entire flow. A proper cookie jar. Consistent client-hint headers.
4. **Sticky/session proxies, never rotating** — the IP you send to the API must match
   the IP the target site sees. Pass your outbound IP as the `ip` input (get it from
   `GET https://ip.hypersolutions.co/ip` with `x-api-key`; see the IP lookup contract in
   `references/tls-and-headers.md`).
5. **Match Chrome versions across the board**: UA version, `sec-ch-ua`, and
   `sec-ch-ua-platform` must agree. Mismatched versions flag automation.

Full detail: `references/tls-and-headers.md`.

## Authentication

Every API request needs the `x-api-key` header (get a key at
https://hypersolutions.co/keys). Optionally add JWT signing (`x-signature`) for
client-side use, or organization headers (`x-app-key` + `x-app-signature`). The SDKs
handle all of this for you. Full detail + code: `references/authentication.md`.

## Install & construct a session

| Language | Package | Construct |
|---|---|---|
| Go | `github.com/Hyper-Solutions/hyper-sdk-go/v3` (v3.0.0+; **v2 is deprecated**) | `hyper.NewSession("api-key")` |
| Python | `hyper-sdk` (PyPI, 3.0.0+) | `Session("api-key")` / `SessionAsync("api-key")` |
| JS/TS | `hyper-sdk-js` (npm, 4.0.0+) | `new Session("api-key")` |

```go
// Go
session := hyper.NewSession("your-api-key").
    WithJwtKey("your-jwt-key").      // optional
    WithClient(customHTTPClient)     // optional
```
```python
# Python (sync) — also SessionAsync with the same signature, methods are awaitable
from hyper_sdk import Session, SensorInput
session = Session("your-api-key", jwt_key=None, app_key=None, app_secret=None)
```
```typescript
// JS/TS
import { Session } from 'hyper-sdk-js';
const session = new Session("your-api-key", jwtKey?, appKey?, appSecret?, options?);
```

- **Go**: product methods are on the `Session` (e.g. `session.GenerateSensorData(ctx, input)`), take a `context.Context` first, and a pointer to an input struct.
- **Python**: product methods are on the session (e.g. `session.generate_sensor_data(input)`); input classes use keyword args.
- **JS/TS**: product operations are **free functions** taking the session as the first arg (e.g. `generateSensorData(session, input)`); input classes use **positional** constructor args (arg order sometimes differs from field order — see `references/api-reference.md`).

No language SDK? Call the REST API directly — see `references/api-reference.md`.

## Which product am I dealing with? (routing)

Identify the anti-bot system, then open the matching reference file.

| System | How to identify it | Reference |
|---|---|---|
| **Akamai** Bot Manager | `_abck` and `bm_sz` cookies; a `<script src="/xxxx/yyyy/...">` dynamic path near end of body. `428` = sec-cpt challenge; `429 {"t":...}` = SBSD block | `references/akamai.md` |
| **Incapsula/Imperva** | Cookie named `reese84` or an `x-d-token` header → reese84. A script like `/_Incapsula_Resource?SWJIYLWA=...` → utmvc. "Pardon Our Interruption" page → reese84 dynamic | `references/incapsula.md` |
| **DataDome** | `403` with a body containing `var dd={...}`. `i.js` referenced → interstitial; `c.js` → slider. `datadome` cookie | `references/datadome.md` |
| **Kasada** | `429` with HTML referencing `ips.js`; `x-kpsdk-*` headers/cookies (`tkrm_alpekz_*`). `x-is-human` header → Vercel BotID | `references/kasada.md` |

## Cross-cutting concerns

- **IP & proxies** — sticky proxies; `GET /ip`; consequences of rotating IPs → covered in `references/tls-and-headers.md`.
- **User agents & Chrome version** — Windows Chrome recommended (macOS Chrome also supported); when/how to bump the version; keep `sec-ch-ua` in sync → `references/tls-and-headers.md`.
- **Compression** — enable it in **both** directions (request payload + response) on basically every call. Pick the codec by language support: **zstd** where it's well-supported (Go), **gzip** otherwise (Python, JS/TS). SDKs auto-compress payloads > 1000 bytes and their defaults already follow this (Go → zstd; Python/JS → gzip) → `references/api-reference.md`.
- **Usage/quota** — `GET https://api.hypersolutions.co/usage` (personal-org API) for remaining quota.
- **Response `headers` object** — most generate endpoints return a `headers` object of client hints (`sec-ch-ua-full-version-list`, `sec-ch-ua-platform`, etc.). **Replay these on the target site; never hardcode them.**

## Debugging

Record the failing host, HTTP status and stage before choosing a cause. Generation
success or a minted token does not establish success: verify the requested target
endpoint and expected response format. A stable IP plus a 403 does not alone prove
proxy reputation; compare the actual TLS profile, helper-checked `sec-ch-ua`, header
order and session state with the working capture before attributing the block.

When an integration is failing (still blocked, challenge won't clear, 403/428/429
persists), the fault is almost always in the **request** (TLS fingerprint, header order,
cookies, IP), not in the generated payload. The most common root causes, in order:

1. TLS fingerprint / header order not actually matching a real browser.
2. IP mismatch (rotating proxy, or API `ip` ≠ target-facing IP).
3. Cookie-jar bugs (missing, duplicated, or wrong-domain cookies).
4. `sec-ch-ua` / UA / platform version mismatch, or hardcoded client hints from a polluted
   browser capture (`Accept-CH` / `Sec-Fetch-Storage-Access` artifacts).
5. Reusing a value that must be fresh (Kasada POW, Akamai context, tokens past renewal).

**Four debugging tools, best first:**

1. **Live capture with powhttp (MCP)** — the ground truth. If the powhttp MCP tools
   (`find_requests`, `get_tls_connection`, `get_http2_streams` — namespaced
   `powhttp_*` when provided by this plugin) are available,
   route the failing script through powhttp, run it, and inspect the **real wire header
   order and TLS fingerprint** — things a HAR can't show. Workflow:
   `references/powhttp-mcp.md`.
2. **HAR analysis (MCP)** — when you have a **HAR** but no live powhttp capture (e.g. a
   customer sent one), pass its contents to `analyze_har` (namespaced
   `har-analyzer_analyze_har`). It returns structured findings
   (severity, category, fix) plus the detected product. **This rule set is kept up to date
   — prefer it over the static `references/request-rules.md`.** Its findings are reliable
   when the HAR was recorded by a debugger that preserves the real wire header order (e.g.
   a **powhttp** export); a HAR from Charles or DevTools normalizes header order, so trust
   its order/pseudo-header findings less. A HAR never carries the TLS fingerprint, so a
   clean result doesn't rule that out — escalate to powhttp. Workflow:
   `references/har-analyzer-mcp.md`.
3. **Request-fingerprinting principles** — `references/request-rules.md` is a concise
   principles reference for the generic fingerprint concepts (header order/case,
   pseudo-header order, sec-ch-ua GREASE, cookies, client-hint/`Accept-CH` pollution,
   Chrome-version policy, header-order shapes). Use it to **analyze a powhttp capture**
   (the HAR MCP can't read powhttp's live TLS / HTTP/2 data), to reason by hand when no MCP
   is available, or to write correct requests up front. Per-product flow checks live in the
   HAR analysis MCP and the product references. It ships a runnable helper,
   `scripts/sec_ch_ua.py`, to compute the exact expected `sec-ch-ua` for any Chrome version
   — use it instead of eyeballing.
4. **Symptom → cause → fix** — `references/debugging.md`, per product and cross-cutting.

## Getting help / escalating to Hyper Solutions

- Working examples for every product × language: the `hypersolutions-examples` repo
  (https://github.com/Hyper-Solutions/hypersolutions-examples). Distilled skeletons are
  in `references/api-reference.md`.
- For support, Hyper Solutions asks for a **HAR captured with powhttp** (not Charles —
  powhttp preserves the real wire header order; see `references/tls-and-headers.md`). HAR
  files contain cookies/tokens — sanitize sensitive data before sharing. Discord:
  `discord.gg/akamai`. You can pre-screen the HAR yourself with the `analyze_har` MCP tool
  (`references/har-analyzer-mcp.md`) before escalating.
